Adding different files in a repository.
It can be a .txt,.java,.cpp,.py etc.
We can change the files description by editing.


Now we want changes but not in master branch.
So we can create a new branch and save this fie.
without effecting the master branch.
And can make any changes later.

Thanks a lot :)
